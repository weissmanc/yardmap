The yardmap repository is code for a Node.js application that implements an online magnet board.
The intent is for it to be used by rail transit yard operators to keep track of trains and
work crews. Cars can be created from pre-loaded graphic symbols, be given colored labels, be grouped
and ungrouped to represent trains. Once created you can add notes to any symbol, change its location,
etc.

Since this is a cloud application it can be seen by any authorized user on the web. Great for
collaboration between maintenance and operations. Also makes it easy to do a walking inventory
using a smartphone.
